# Placement Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of a regression model using TensorFlow to predict placement outcomes based on various student features. The model is trained on a placement dataset and aims to provide insights into factors influencing placement success.

# Features
Dataset: The placement dataset includes features such as academic performance, extracurricular involvement, and interview scores.

# Model Architecture:

Neural network with multiple dense layers.
Activation functions: Leaky ReLU and Tanh.
Loss function: MeanSquaredError.
Trained for 100 epochs.
Evaluation:

Model evaluation through training and validation loss curves.
Focused on minimizing mean squared error for accurate predictions.

# Highlights
Goal: Predict placement success based on student data.
Normalization: Dataset normalized to improve training efficiency.
Performance Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), model accuracy, and visualized loss curves.

# Files Included
placement_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the model implementation.
placement_dataset.csv: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
README.md: Project documentation.
plots/: Visualizations of training and validation loss curves.


# Results
Training MSE: Achieved a low error rate after 100 epochs.
Validation Loss: Minimal overfitting with smooth loss curve transitions.

# Future Enhancements
Add feature engineering techniques for better accuracy.
Explore different activation functions and hyperparameter tuning.
Extend to classification for categorical placement outcomes (placed/not placed).
# Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
