Overview
Traffic prediction is essential for urban planning, minimizing congestion, and improving travel experiences. This project employs a neural network to predict traffic values based on historical data. By analyzing features and normalizing data, the model demonstrates the capability to provide reliable traffic forecasts, aiding transportation systems worldwide.

Dataset

The dataset contains features related to traffic patterns, including:

Traffic Volume: The target variable to predict.
Weather Conditions: Metrics such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Time Features: Day of the week, hour of the day, etc.
Road Attributes: Information about road type and surrounding infrastructure.
Data Preprocessing
Normalization: Features were normalized using StandardScaler to improve training efficiency.
Splitting: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Architecture
The neural network was designed with the following architecture:

Input Layer: Takes normalized traffic-related features as input.
Hidden Layers:
Three fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions for capturing non-linear patterns.
Output Layer: A single neuron for continuous output to predict traffic values.
The model was compiled using:

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient training.
Training the Model
The model was trained on the dataset for 60 epochs with the following configuration:

python
Copy code
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mae'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=60, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
During training, the loss values and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were monitored to ensure proper learning.

Evaluation
The trained model was evaluated using:

Test Loss: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Indicates how far off predictions are on average.
Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:

Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}
Test MAE: {test_mae:.4f}
Visualization
The training and validation loss curves were plotted to analyze performance across epochs. A consistent decline in loss indicates that the model learned effectively from the data.
